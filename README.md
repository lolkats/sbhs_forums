SBHS Forums
===========
This is a software package for our school. It is a useless forum, pretty much.
##Dependencies##
- Nodejs (v0.10>) recommended
- A working mongodb - More database support in the future (maybe)
- Grunt CLI
- Redis session store

##How to Run##
- Download of course
- Do a npm install
- grunt it
- Drink some coffee
- run npm start
- Wait for it
- Then load http://localhost:3000/

##Current State of Project##
Many things don't really work. Its just a skeleton for now. Login via SBHS works now.
